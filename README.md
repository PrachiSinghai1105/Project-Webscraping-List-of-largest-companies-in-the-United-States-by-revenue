In this web scraping project, I aimed to extract information from the Wikipedia page titled "List of largest companies in the United States by revenue." First, I imported essential libraries, including BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and requests for fetching web content. Next, I specified the URL and retrieved the HTML content of the page. By creating a BeautifulSoup object, I could navigate and interact with the HTML structure. Using this object, I located the target table on the Wikipedia page and identified the column headers (table titles). Subsequently, I employed Pandas to create an empty DataFrame with the extracted column titles. The next steps involved finding and populating the DataFrame with data from each row of the table. Finally, I saved the populated DataFrame into a CSV file, creating a structured output of the information extracted from the web page. This comprehensive approach showcases my utilization of Python, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas to automate the process of web scraping and data extraction for further analysis or use.
